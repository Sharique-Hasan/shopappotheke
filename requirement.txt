The service should be able to provide:
    • A list of the most popular repositories, sorted by number of stars.
    • An option to be able to view the top 10, 50, 100 repositories should be available.
    • Given a date, the most popular repositories created from this date onwards should be returned.
    • A filter for the programming language would be a great addition to have.
